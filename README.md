	virtualenv venv 
	source venv/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt 
```
## Start jupyter 
```bash
	jupyter-notebook
```

The examples provided are: 

1. [Data Cleaning:](data_cleaning.ipynb) clean the data, filling missing inforation
2. [Data Exploration:](data_exploration.ipynb) see how the data is distributed, find outliers  
3. [Clustering:](clustering.ipynb) perform clustering methods to find patterns in the data
4. [Classification:](classification.ipynb) classify sales according to the money spent 
5. [Recommender System:](recommender-system.ipynb) generate recommendations based on the users' history 


The examples 2,3,4 and 5 use the cleaned data result from the data cleaning process.
